The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a document or collection before the `onSnapshot` listener has fully initialized. This can happen if you attempt to perform an operation on the data immediately after attaching the listener.  Another potential problem is when using transactions with specific conditions that may not be met and result in unexpected errors. There might be a timing issue involved, particularly when dealing with asynchronous operations.
